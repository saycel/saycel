## About

SayCel enables small and rural communities to own and operate their own cellular service utility and local 911. Our focus is on areas with inadequate or exorbitantly expensive services. We believe communications is a modern human right. This page is a working documentation for how our networks are built.

1. Ubuntu - All of our BSC's have Ubuntu 12.04.5 installed. [This section](documentation/SayCel_Install_2015.md) walks you through the installation process.
2. OpenVPN - We use an OpenVPN server to remotely connect and configure our BSC's. This section walks you through the VPN installation on the client (BSC) and server (openVPN)
3. Puppet - We use puppet to manage all of our BSC and to install all of the necessary packages
