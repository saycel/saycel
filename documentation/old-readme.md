# SayCel

SayCel currently operates the first community cellular network on Little Corn Island, Nicaragua, and we have plans to install 2 additional networks in Nicaragua by August of 2015

SayCel enables developing communities with non-existent, inadequate, or exorbitantly expensive cellular networks the opportunity to have their own cellular utility and local 911 service. Residents are able to call other regions and countries much cheaper than with the current telecom system. Saycel provides maintenance and training to community governments so they can manage the cell network. Local governments are able to have a sustainable communications utility that they can use to lower the cost of communication for citizens, improve security through a local 911, assist in growing their local economies, and increase efficiency in their local government and international development projects.
